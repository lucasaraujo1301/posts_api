# Default Django Project
I created this repository to be my start to my future Django projects that will be used to create APIs and using
the JWT login.

# About
As I told before, the only thing you will need is to fork this repository. Follow the steps bellow if you need change something.

# Steps
If you need to change anything from User Model, be adding new columns, adding to needed groups to the user.

Go to `core.models` and change in the `class User` and have fun.

After doing everything, just run the docker container and go create your api.
